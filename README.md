**ADS-B funhouse**
==========

This is a collection of Python scripts for playing with [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance-broadcast) data from [dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090). You will need an [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) receiver to join the fun.  You will also need the Paho-MQTT client for your installed version of Python (usually installed with the command `pip install paho-mqtt`).

## adsbclient.py

This is yet another ADS-B decoder written in Python. It feeds off port 30003 on your dump1090 receiver and publishes each message to your MQTT broker. It is invoked using:

`% adsbclient.py -H <dump1090 host> -m <MQTT host> -r <radar name> -mdb myplanedb`

The MQTT publish topic is `/adsb/<radar name>/json` and the JSON data contains the following fields:

| Key          |  Description                              | Sample data                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| icao24       | ICAO24 designator                         | "4787B0"
| loggedDate   | Local timestamp                           | "2015-09-08 21:08:26.061000" 
| operator     | Name of airline                           | "Cathay Pacific Airways"
| type         | Type of aircraft                          | "Boeing 777 367ER"
| registration | Aircrafts ICAO registration               | "B-KPY"
| callsign     | Flight's callsign                         | "CPA257"
| lost         | `true` if receiver lost sight of aircraft | `false`

| altitude     | Altitude [feet]                           | 17500 
| lon          | Lontitudee                                | 13.33108 
| lat          | Latitude                                  | 55.29126
| verticalRate | Vertical climb/descend rate [ft/min]      | 2240

The aircraft's operator, type and registration are not available in the ADS-B data the aircraft transmits and needs to be pulled from another data source. One excellent source is [PlaneBaseNG](http://planebase.biz) with about 147k aircraft and can be downloaded [here](http://planebase.biz/bstnsqb). Another source is [Virtual Radar Server](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Files/BaseStation.zip) with ~77k aircraft, mainly UK ones.

If you often see aircraft that are not found in the above databases you can add them manually to your own database and tell adsbclient.py to search it too using the argument `--myplanedb`. Invoking adsbclient.py with a non existent database will create and initialize the database in the specified file.

The following arguments are supported by adsbclient.py:

| Key                  | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help               | well...
| --radar-name NAME    | name of radar, used as topic string /adsb/NAME/json
| --mqtt-host HOST     | MQTT broker hostname
| --mqtt-port PORT     | MQTT broker port number (default 1883)
| --dump1090-host HOST | dump1090 hostname
| --dump1090-port PORT | dump1090 port number (default 30003)
| --verbose            | Verbose output
| --basestationdb DB   | BaseStation SQLite DB 
| --myplanedb DB       | Your own SQLite DB with the same structure as BaseStation.sqb where you can add planes missing from the BaseStation db

## proxclient.py

This script subscribes to the JSON radar data from `adsbclient.py` and calculates the distance to the nearest aircraft using your location and makes an Bing image search for an image of the aircraft (you will need a Bing API key for this, see `bingconfig.py`).

`% proxclient.py -m <MQTT host> -l <your latitude> -L <your longitude> --imagedb planeimgs.sqb`

The default publish topic is `/adsb/<prox name>/json` and the JSON data contains the following fields:

| Key          |  Description                         | Sample data

| --imagedb DB         | An SQLite DB where the URLs to aircraft images are stored locally

## airline-colors.py

This script allows commercial pilots to, unknowingly I might add, change your moodlight. Any MQTT controllable moodlight can be set to light up in the prominent color of the airline's logo, dimmed accodring to distance to the plane.

Subscribing to the JSON data from `proxclient.py`, it fetches the logo for the airline that operates the nearest flight and calculates the prominent color of their logo. The color is dimmed according to distance and posted to an MQTT topic.

The prominent color in the logo is the one found in the most pixels, white and black excluded. Colors are cached in a file called `logocolors.json`.

`% airline-colors.py -m <MQTT host> -d <max distance> -t <color topic>`

The default publish topic is `airlinecolor` containing the message `#RRGGBB`

The following arguments are supported by:

| Key         | Description                                                       |
| ------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| --help      | well...
| --mqtt-host | MQTT broker hostname
| --mqtt-port | MQTT broker port number (default 1883)
| --distance  | max distance in kilometers, the color will be black (#000000) for aircraft beyond this distance
| --topic     | the topic to post color data to
| --verbose   | Verbose output
